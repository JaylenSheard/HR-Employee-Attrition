## Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze various factors affecting employee attrition and build a robust predictive model to help companies identify employees who are likely to leave. Understanding these factors enables HR departments to take preventive measures to retain valuable employees.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analysis of employee demographics such as gender, age, education level, and marital status.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Insightful visualizations of attrition rates by gender, department, salary, and more.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Development of a machine learning model with 98% accuracy to predict employees at risk of attrition.

## Data Exploration

The analysis explores various features of the dataset, such as:

- Attrition rates per gender, department, and salary.
- The impact of marital status on attrition.
- The correlation between job roles and attrition rates.

## Modeling Techniques

The following techniques were utilized to build the predictive model:

- Train-Test Split
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Key Findings
- Attrition is highest among employees aged 18 to 35 and decreases with age.
- Attrition is highest among the Sales Department with Sales Representatives having an attrition rate of nearly 40%. 
- Employees with lower income levels have an attrition rate at nearly 15% higher than those with higher incomes.
- Women aged 18-29 are more likely to attrition across all age groups.
